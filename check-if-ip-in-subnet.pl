# the above file likes to think it is gzipped, but it is not. plaintext is returned.
# the source above gives a complete list of ip address ranges. other sites only gave ranges above a certain size (usually 16,384)
# the question remains: do i want ip address information from a third party? or should i get it from the source? (IANA/ARIN)

# Organizations:
# ICANN - Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
# IANA - Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
# ARIN - American Registry for Internet Numbers
# APNIC - Asia Pacific Network Information Centre
# The function of these organizations can be found here:
# https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/welcome-2012-02-25-en
# " What Does ICANN Do?
#   ICANN coordinates the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions. "
#
# All of these organizations are not for profit.
# ICANN seems to be the global governing body of internet address space, protocols, regulations, and standards.
# ICANN is contracted by the U.S. Government.
# ICANN employs the IANA to help with the internet address portion of their responsibilities.
# The IANA evaluates and assigns IP address space as requested by regional IP address registries.
# The North American registry is "ARIN", the Asia-Pacific registry is "APNIC". These are the largest.
# There are currently only three smaller registries: AfriNIC, RIPE, and LACNIC.
# Each internet-connected country on our planet has their address space governed by one of these registries.
# A complete list of countries and their associated registries can be found on the APNIC website:
# https://www.apnic.net/services/apply-for-resources/iso-3166-codes
#
# Due to the IANA's global nature, they maintain an index of allocated IP address space on their website:
# http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv4-address-space/ipv4-address-space.xml
# This index is the global standard, it is very complete.  The most useful information here is that
# not only is each IP address allocation's organization listed, but their associated registry is 
# noted as well.  At very least, this should allow IP addresses to be regionally (or continentally) located.

# Work to do:
# I need to compare results gathered from ipaddresslocation.org against the subnet prefixes in the IANA document.
# I do not know if all the smaller subnets are accounted for.  I am not sure how they could be, seeing as they're
# sometimes only a dozen IP addresses in size and all the IANA prefixes are /8 (~16.8M addresses).

# should also account for private ip address space:
# https://www.arin.net/simplewebutils/whatsmyip.html
# 10.0.0.0/8 IP addresses: 10.0.0.0 -- 10.255.255.255
# 172.16.0.0/12 IP addresses: 172.16.0.0 -- 172.31.255.255
# 192.168.0.0/16 IP addresses: 192.168.0.0 â€“ 192.168.255.255

# I am no longer sure what the scope of this project is.
# Perhaps it will be to provide rough geolocation services for requested addresses.
